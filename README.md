## Contributions

As this repository serves as a personal sandbox, I am not currently accepting contributions. However, feel free to use the code in your own projects or as a reference for learning. If you find any issues or errors in the code, please feel free to create an issue and I will do my best to address it.

## Conclusion

I created this repository to learn the basics of Spring and Hibernate and to have a place to practice my skills. I hope that this repository can be helpful to others who are also learning these technologies.
